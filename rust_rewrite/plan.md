## Phase 8: Cross-Platform & Deployment üåê

**Goal**: Ensure compatibility across platforms and prepare for distribution.

- [ ] Test and fix platform-specific issues
  - [ ] Windows
  - [ ] macOS
  - [ ] Linux
- [ ] WebAssembly support

## Implementation Priorities

For each phase, we'll prioritize in this order:
1. Core functionality (must-have features)
2. Basic visual styling (to match the cyberpunk theme)
3. GPU optimizations and advanced effects
4. Polishing and refinement

## Technology Selection Details

- **Graphics**: wgpu (already implemented)
- **Windowing**: winit (already implemented)
- **Text Rendering**: wgpu_glyph (already implemented)
- **Serialization**: serde + serde_json/toml
- **Math/Geometry**: glam or nalgebra
- **Asset Management**: Consider asset loading crates like `assets_manager`
- **Logging/Debugging**: tracing/tracing-subscriber for more advanced logging

## Next Steps

1. Complete Phase 5 (Advanced GPU Effects)
   - Set up shader pipeline for neon effects
   - Create post-processing effects for cyberpunk aesthetic
2. Begin work on Phase 6 (Input & Interaction Enhancement)
   - Implement Vim-inspired navigation
   - Polish mouse interactions and context menus
3. Continually update this plan as development progresses
